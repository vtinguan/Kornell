	 *Additional behavior:  A SCO has the option of setting the 
cmi.core.exit to one of four values.  Based on the value, the LMS 
behavior should be as follows: 
If the SCO set the cmi.core.exit to “time-out” the LMS 
should set cmi.core.entry to “” (empty) upon the next 
launching of the SCO. 
If the SCO set the cmi.core.exit to “suspend” the LMS 
should set the cmi.core.entry to “resume” upon the next 
launching of the SCO. 
If the SCO set the cmi.core.exit to “logout” the LMS 
should set the cmi.core.entry to “” (empty) upon the next 
launching of the SCO.  In addition, the LMS should log 
the student out of the course when the SCO that set the 
cmi.core.exit to “logout” has issued the LMSFinish() or 
the user navigates away. 
If the SCO set the cmi.core.exit to “” (empty) the LMS 
should set the cmi.core.entry to “” (empty) upon the next 
launching of the SCO. 
If the SCO did not set the cmi.core.exit to any value that 
LMS should set cmi.core.entry to “” (empty) upon the 
next launching of the SCO.
