	 * Additional Behavior:  A SCO is able, in a single running, to 
			perform multiple sets of the cmi.core.session_time.  When the 
			SCO issues the LMSFinish() or the user navigates away, the LMS 
			should take the last cmi.core.session_time that the SCO set (if 
			there was a set) and accumulate this time to the 
			cmi.core.total_time.  Upon subsequent launch of the SCO, and a 
			LMSGetValue() call for cmi.core.total_time, the LMS should return 
			the accumulated time.  LMS’s should not accumulate multiple time 
			sent to the LMS by the LMSSetValue() call for 
			cmi.core.session_time.  If multiple calls to LMSSetValue() for 
			cmi.core.session_time are made the LMS should overwrite any 
			existing value that it is persisting for cmi.core.session_time.
